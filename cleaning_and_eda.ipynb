    "## Project Overview\n",
    "We chose the Spotify Tracks Dataset to analyze the factors that affect the popularity of a song. From the column descriptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"popularity: The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we want to analyze the factors that determine this popularity, such as artist, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, tempo, etc. Then, we will test our model to see if it can ascertain the correct probability in the validation and testing datasets, and see if our model matches the provided algorithm. We will specifically be analyzing songs in the \"pop\" genre, combining pop, mando-pop, k-pop, etc.\n",
